# ML Projects Repository 🚀

Welcome to my machine learning projects repository! This is a collection of projects I've built while learning and exploring various concepts in machine learning, from basic implementations to more advanced applications.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
ML_projects/
├── [Project Name]/             # Each project in its own directory
│   ├── readme.md              # Project-specific documentation
│   ├── main.py                # Main application file
│   ├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies (if needed)
│   ├── data/                  # Data files and datasets
│   ├── models/                # Trained models and weights
│   └── utils/                 # Utility functions and helpers
├── README.md                  # Main repository documentation
└── .gitignore                 # Git ignore file
```

Each project follows a similar structure with its own documentation, source code, and dependencies.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+ (recommended: Python 3.8+)
- pip (Python package installer)
- other python packages

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ML_projects
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for each project:**

   - **AI Agent**: Requires `google-generativeai` and `python-dotenv` packages
   - **Style Transfer App**: Install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - **SmolGrad**: No external dependencies required (pure Python implementation)

3. **Set up API keys** (for AI Agent):
   - Create a `.env` file in the `AI_agent/` directory
   - Add your Google Gemini API key: `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

Each project can be run independently. Check the individual project README files for specific usage instructions.

## 🔧 Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Core ML:** TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas
- **AI/LLM:** Google Generative AI (Gemini)
- **Web Development:** Streamlit
- **Image Processing:** Pillow, OpenCV
- **Utilities:** python-dotenv, requests, tqdm
